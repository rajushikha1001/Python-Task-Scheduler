# Python-Task-Scheduler
Objective: Create a simple task scheduler that runs tasks at specified intervals.

Task:
Implement a basic task scheduler in Python that accepts a list of tasks (functions) to be run at specified intervals (e.g., every 5 seconds).
Steps:
Write a Python script task_scheduler.py that:
Accepts a list of tasks and their execution intervals.
Uses Pythonâ€™s threading or asyncio to run tasks periodically.
Bonus: Allow dynamic task addition and removal during runtime.
